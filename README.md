# SciRust 🦀

> A pure-Rust deep learning framework — SIMD CPU kernels, reverse-mode
> autograd, batch normalization, convolutions, and data parallelism.
> (A portable wgpu GEMM is wired behind the optional `wgpu` feature, tested
> against the CPU oracle on software Vulkan — see docs/GPU.md.)
> No C++, no Python, no FFI — just Rust from top to bottom.

## Why?

Existing Rust ML libraries either wrap libtorch (`tch`), wrap ONNX runtime,
or are research toys. SciRust is the middle path: a real framework with
real ops, but written entirely in Rust so you can read every line of compute,
modify it, and trust it.

It's not the fastest framework on the planet. It's the one you can **fully
understand**, modify safely, and extend without crossing language boundaries.

## Positioning

A research artifact: a pure-Rust deep-learning and scientific-computing stack built and
validated from scratch — a runtime plus a transpiler layer — rather than a wrapper
over libtorch or ONNX. The guiding discipline is that every primitive is accepted only
after its output matches a reference oracle, with reproducibility measured rather than
assumed (in several cases bit-for-bit). SciRust is not a production competitor to PyTorch,
Burn, or candle; it is a framework you can read, modify, and trust, with its claims backed
by measurements.

## Validated capabilities

Every result below is reproduced by code in this repository and documented in the
technical report ([`paper/SciRust-technical-report.md`](paper/SciRust-technical-report.md)).

- **Deep-learning core + reverse-mode autodiff** — 1718 passing workspace tests (0 failures; measured 2026-06-19); an MLP reaches 97.70% on MNIST.
- **N-D autograd stack, research-backed and gradient-checked** — a complete causal **decoder LM** (token + positional embeddings, causal attention, fused softmax cross-entropy) that trains end-to-end and overfits a sequence *exactly*; LLaMA-family layers (**RMSNorm**, **SwiGLU**, **RoPE**, **grouped/multi-query attention**); a **LoRA** low-rank adapter (frozen base + trainable `B·A`, gradient-checked); deterministic optimizers (**Adam, AdamW, Lion, Muon, Schedule-Free, AdEMAMix, SOAP** — Adam in Shampoo's eigenbasis, with a from-scratch Jacobi eigensolver — plus **Lookahead, LAMB, Adan**); **exact speculative decoding** and **FlashAttention** (online softmax); a **DeltaNet** delta-rule linear-attention layer, a **Mamba** selective state-space layer (S6 input-dependent scan), a **RetNet** retention layer (recurrent form proven equal to the parallel form), a **GLA** gated-linear-attention layer (data-dependent forget gate), and an **HGRN** gated-linear-RNN token mixer, all linear-time recurrences unrolled on the tape; a **Neural ODE** (backprop through an RK4 solver); a **Physics-Informed Neural Network** that solves a boundary-value problem with the PDE residual in the loss (recovers `sin x` to ~4 decimals). Every op is validated by a finite-difference gradient check. See [`docs/RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md`](docs/RESEARCH_ROADMAP.md).
- **Certifiable & reproducible** — **Interval Bound Propagation** and **CROWN** (linear-relaxation back-substitution, provably *tighter* than IBP) give *provable* output bounds and robustness certificates for ReLU MLPs, shown side by side (`scirust certify`); **conformal prediction** gives distribution-free prediction sets with a *guaranteed* coverage level (`scirust conformal`); **temperature scaling** recalibrates over-confident probabilities (lowers the expected calibration error without touching accuracy, `scirust calibrate`); **order-independent floating-point reductions** are bit-identical regardless of thread count; **Wanda** pruning, **SmoothQuant**, **GPTQ** (second-order error-feedback weight quantization — beats round-to-nearest on calibration error, `scirust gptq`), **AWQ** (activation-aware search-based per-channel scaling, `scirust awq`), **BitNet b1.58** (ternary `{−1,0,+1}` weights, ~1.58 bit/weight, with a verified multiplication-free matmul, `scirust bitnet`), and **NF4** (QLoRA's 4-bit NormalFloat — quantile-matched levels that beat uniform 4-bit on Gaussian weights) extend the deterministic int8 path.
- **Portable GPU compute (wgpu, optional)** — a real WGSL `f32` GEMM behind the `wgpu` feature, validated against the CPU oracle on a software Vulkan adapter (Mesa lavapipe) in CI, plumbed into the autograd tape (`Var::matmul_gpu` forward + backward via `WgpuEngine`) **and** into Conv2d's im2col GEMMs (forward + backward). ⚠ *Separately, a historical cuBLAS-backed BF16 matmul once reached ~63 TFLOPS on an NVIDIA Jetson Thor (aarch64); that CUDA path is archived in [`archive/scirust-gpu/`](archive/scirust-gpu/), not reproducible from today's build — see `scirust_complete_audit_report.md` §5.*
- **Deterministic inference runtime** — bit-exact forward (a 64-bit output fingerprint identical across thread counts and processes), bounded latency (p99/p50 ~1.15), and architecture-agnostic reconstruction from a plain-text manifest plus an SRT1 weight file.
- **Certified-deterministic multi-thread training** — `DataParallelTrainer::train_batch_threaded` runs workers across N OS threads yet reduces gradients in a fixed worker order, so the aggregate is **bit-identical for 1/2/4/8 threads** and equal to the sequential path (float addition isn't associative — the reduction order is pinned). CI-tested, including a real autograd backward. To our knowledge, SciRust is the only **self-contained** DL framework (100 % auditable Rust stack, zero FFI in the compute path) that simultaneously offers CI-tested bit-identical multi-thread training (1/2/4/8 threads == sequential), a deterministic int8 pipeline for embedded targets, and audit artifacts (inference fingerprints, hash-chained logs, manifest-based reconstruction). Closest related work: RepDL (Microsoft, 2025, [arXiv:2510.09180](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09180)) provides **cross-platform** bitwise reproducibility for a float32 subset of PyTorch via correctly-rounded operations — a stronger guarantee on that axis for f32, but as an overlay on a C++/Python TCB, without low-precision support and without audit artifacts. SciRust's integer and fixed-point paths are bit-exact cross-platform; its sanitized f32 path is deterministic within a single architecture.
- **Deterministic int8 quantization for embedded** — weight-only int8 is lossless and 4x smaller; a fully-integer calibrated pipeline reproduces the float model bit-for-bit; a true integer convolution and a portable QSR1 / QModel artifact; an aarch64 NEON int8 kernel ~10x faster and bit-exact against the scalar reference; separable depthwise + pointwise convolutions in deterministic int8.
- **Symbolic regression** — a hybrid genetic-gradient engine recovers closed-form laws (structure and constants) from data, fitting constants with the framework's own symbolic differentiation.
- **Evolutionary optimization** (`scirust-evo`) — NSGA-II recovers the ZDT1 Pareto front to within ~1e-3; the simplified single-objective optimizers are honest about their limits (see the report).
- **Industrial & automotive monitoring** (`scirust-signal`, `scirust-opcua`, `scirust-mqtt`, `scirust-pdm`, `scirust-mlops`, `scirust-func-safety`, `scirust-integration`) — signal processing (FFT, windows, bearing BPFO/BPFI/BSF diagnostics, order analysis, **radar** — pulse-compression (LFM chirp / Barker codes, matched filtering with exact energy/peak-to-sidelobe oracles), the **ambiguity function** (joint delay-Doppler response with the LFM range-Doppler coupling ridge), **Doppler processing** (range-Doppler map — stationary vs. moving targets separated into zero- vs. non-zero-Doppler bins), **MTI clutter cancellers** (binomial pulse cancellers with an exact DC null), **CFAR detection** (cell-averaging & ordered-statistic, the latter robust to interfering targets that mask CA-CFAR; false-alarm rate validated statistically — plus a **2-D CFAR** over the range-Doppler map with **connected-component clustering** of detections into amplitude-weighted target centroids, then **target tracking** — α–β constant-velocity track filters and a nearest-neighbour multi-target tracker with track birth/death, plus a full constant-velocity **Kalman filter** (adaptive gain, live covariance, innovation likelihood) and an **IMM** (Interacting Multiple Model) estimator that blends a quiet and an agile model by Markov mode probabilities to follow manoeuvring targets with less lag than any fixed filter, a **planar coordinated-turn IMM** — a general n-state linear Kalman filter (Cholesky measurement update) blending constant-velocity and constant-turn-rate models to track turning targets in the (x, y) plane, following the arc instead of overshooting it — an **extended Kalman filter** that tracks a Cartesian state directly from raw **polar range/bearing** radar measurements (nonlinear observation linearised by its Jacobian, azimuth innovation wrapped across the ±π boundary), and a **multi-target tracker** of per-target EKFs associated by a **statistical NIS (normalised-innovation-squared) validation gate** — a χ²-thresholded Mahalanobis distance that adapts to each track's own uncertainty, with track birth/death — closing the OpenRadar detection→track pipeline), **array processing** (ULA steering vectors, delay-and-sum beamforming, DOA estimation, high-resolution **MVDR/Capon** — resolving two sources closer than the array beamwidth where the conventional beamformer merges them, via a from-scratch complex Hermitian inverse — **MUSIC** subspace direction finding, built on a from-scratch complex-Hermitian eigensolver (cyclic Jacobi), and gridless **ESPRIT** — reading the angles straight off the eigenvalues of the subarray-subspace rotation, resolving off-grid sources without a spectral scan, via a from-scratch complex eigensolver (Hessenberg reduction + shifted QR)) and **FMCW / mmWave processing** (beat-frequency ranging, range resolution, and the range-Doppler cube built from raw beat chirps by two FFTs — fast-time range and slow-time Doppler — the automotive/OpenRadar model), and an extensible **denoising & noise-detection** toolkit — linear/rank/transform/variational/adaptive families behind a `Denoiser` trait (Savitzky-Golay, Hampel, Wiener, Haar/Daubechies-4/6/8 wavelet shrinkage with universal or per-level SURE thresholds, spectral subtraction, iterative and **exact** (Condat, KKT-certified) total variation, Kalman RTS smoothers — local-level auto-tuned by innovation whiteness, and local linear-trend — plus LMS/RLS adaptive line enhancers), a noise characterizer that classifies Gaussian/impulsive/periodic/colored/baseline disturbances, and a detect-then-denoise auto pipeline with a residual whiteness self-check that flags when information leaks into the "noise"), OPC-UA PLC connectivity with 8 simulated sensors, MQTT SparkPlug B publishing, predictive maintenance (Health Index, RUL, CUSUM, 4 fault detectors), industrial MLOps (drift, shadow deploy, signed OTA), ISO 26262 functional safety (ASIL A-D, fault injection, degraded mode, hash-chained audit log), integration kit (unified Backend/Pipeline/Config/templates), and a dedicated `scirust-industrial` CLI (discover, test, gen-config, scaffold, run, doctor — plus the vertical demos below).
- **State estimation, navigation, water & OT security** (`scirust-estimation`, `scirust-nav`, `scirust-water`, `scirust-ids`, `scirust-func-safety`) — Kalman / IMM / **UD square-root** filters (covariance positive-semidefinite by construction), **GNSS/INS fusion** and **TDOA** multilateration, acoustic **leak correlation** and water-hammer physics (Joukowsky/Korteweg), OT **firmware attestation** and **PLC ladder integrity** (Stuxnet write-set detection) on a tamper-evident hash chain, and a **GMP golden-batch** comparator (DTW alignment + hash-chained 21 CFR Part 11 audit). All reachable from the `scirust-industrial` CLI: `nav-tdoa`, `nav-fusion`, `track-imm`, `track-ud`, `water-leak`, `water-surge`, `ot-firmware`, `ot-plc`, `golden-batch`. Validated on x86 and natively on a **Jetson AGX Thor** via [`docs/TEST_PROTOCOL.md`](docs/TEST_PROTOCOL.md).
- **Process safety / Safety Instrumented Systems** (`scirust-reliability`, `scirust-sis`) — IEC 61511/61508 `PFDavg`/`PFH`/SIL for the full 1oo1/1oo2/2oo2/2oo3/1oo3 MooN voting family (validated against a published NTNU worked example, not just hand derivation), a full SIF loop model (sensors → logic solver → final elements, summed `PFDavg`), fault injection showing e.g. that 2oo3 tolerates one failed channel while 2oo2 does not, deterministic cause-and-effect matrices, and proof-test-interval sizing by numerically inverting `PFDavg` (reusing `scirust-solvers::roots::bisection`) — the direct answer to Triton/Trisis-style unauditable SIS logic, exposed as MCP tools (`sis_verify_sif_loop`, `sis_size_proof_test_interval`).
- **Pattern detection** (`scirust-vision`, `scirust-audio`, `scirust-graph`, `scirust-sequential`, `scirust-multivariate`, `scirust-unsupervised`, `scirust-seasonal`, `scirust-nlp-advanced`) — computer vision (CNN, HOG, LBP, Canny, Otsu, NMS, plus **optronics / precision-optics imaging** — Gaussian **and diffraction-limited Airy PSFs** (with the Rayleigh resolution limit `1.22·λ/D`), MTF with the MTF50 resolution metric, **Richardson–Lucy (spatial) and Wiener (frequency-domain) deconvolution** for EO/IR image restoration, and ray optics: ABCD ray-transfer matrices with Gaussian-beam propagation via the complex q-parameter for optical-train design), audio (MFCC, chroma, pitch YIN, onset detection), graph patterns (subgraph isomorphism, motif discovery, community detection, betweenness), sequential (HMM, CRF, DTW, KMP/Boyer-Moore), multivariate (PCA, ICA, K-Means++, MDS, CCA), unsupervised (autoencoder, isolation forest, DBSCAN, LOF, GMM), seasonal (STL, ACF/PACF, Mann-Kendall, CUSUM), NLP (NER, LDA, TextRank, MinHash, NaiveBayes).
- **Algorithm creation** (`scirust-automl`, `scirust-synthesis`, `scirust-algogen`, `scirust-codetrans`, `scirust-rl-algo`, `scirust-scaffold`) — AutoML (Bayesian optimization, GP surrogate, model selection, ensembles), program synthesis (30+ ops, sketch-based, bottom-up/top-down/GP/beam search), algorithm generation (sort/search/graph/DP/DaC, complexity analysis), code transformation (AST, pattern matching, 20 optimization rules, refactoring, Rust→Python/C transpilation), RL-based discovery (REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, Q-Learning, MCTS, meta-learning), scaffolding (DSL, code gen, 16 templates, docs).
- **General-purpose linear algebra & optimization** (`scirust-solvers`) — beyond LU/QR/Cholesky/conjugate-gradient: a general dense **symmetric eigendecomposition** (Householder + implicit QL, Wilkinson shift), a general dense **SVD** (one-sided Jacobi), a **randomized SVD** (Halko-Martinsson-Tropp, seeded `SplitMix64` for bit-reproducible projections), restarted **GMRES** and **BiCGSTAB** for nonsymmetric matrix-free systems with a Jacobi preconditioner, **Anderson acceleration** for fixed-point iterations, and a bound-constrained **spectral projected gradient** optimizer — all deterministic (fixed iteration budgets, sequential orthogonalization), all from scratch.
- **Agent connectivity & safe OT/IT discovery** (`scirust-mcp`, `scirust-discovery`) — a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server exposing SciRust's solvers, dev tools, discovery, the regulated-industry vertical primitives, and now the **simulation environments** (`sim_epidemic` runs an SIR outbreak; `sim_battery_discharge` runs the Thévenin 1-RC cell plant; `sim_grid_stability` analyzes the swing-equation operating point and transient; `sim_hvac_zone` runs the 2R2C building-zone thermal model; `sim_pharmacokinetics_oral` runs the oral one-compartment drug model with its C_max/t_max/AUC oracles; `sim_stiff_robertson` integrates the canonical stiff Robertson kinetics with the implicit Rosenbrock solver where an explicit method blows up) as standard MCP tools callable by any agent (the in-house `scirust-sciagent` SLM, Claude, ChatGPT, a script) with a SHA-256 hash-chained audit log per call; and consent-scoped, protocol-native OT/IT asset discovery (OPC-UA UACP handshake, Modbus Read Device Identification, mDNS/DNS-SD, BACnet/IP Who-Is/I-Am, SNMPv1 sysDescr, EtherNet/IP ListIdentity — never a generic port scan, following the IEC 62443 zone/conduit model and NIST SP 800-82 doctrine) so an agent can find what industrial hardware is actually reachable before driving it. See [`docs/DOMAIN_ROADMAP.md`](docs/DOMAIN_ROADMAP.md) for the researched regulated-industry verticals this connector layer is meant to unlock.
- **Regulated-industry vertical primitives** (`scirust-grid`, `scirust-biomed`, `scirust-maritime`, `scirust-fab`, `scirust-agtech`, `scirust-fatigue`, `scirust-tolerance`, `scirust-sis`) — one primitive per researched domain in `docs/DOMAIN_ROADMAP.md`, each with a worked-example or reference-implementation verification and an honest "not delivered" boundary rather than a guessed formula: power-grid **WLS state estimation** with bad-data detection and mho-characteristic **distance-relay** logic (`scirust-grid`); a closed-loop dosing **PID + insulin-on-board + Control-Barrier-Function safety filter** stack, explicitly not a clinical device (`scirust-biomed::control`) — whose glucose plant (`dG/dt = -a·(G-G_b)-k·u`) also implements `scirust_sim::System` behind an optional `sim` feature, so the shared simulation engine integrates the vertical's own model directly (the "reverse direction" of the sim layer, verified against the closed-form `G(t) = G* + (G0-G*)·e^{-a·t}`); **COLREG encounter classification**, **CPA/TCPA** collision-risk assessment, and weighted-pseudo-inverse **thrust allocation** for dynamic positioning (`scirust-maritime`); **EWMA run-to-run** recipe control and **PCA-based T²/SPE** fault detection (`scirust-fab`); a reproducible **yield-map** cleaning pipeline (global+local outlier filters, IDW) and the verified ISO 25119-2 risk-parameter model (`scirust-agtech`); **ASTM E1049 rainflow** cycle counting (ported and verified against an independent reference implementation) plus **Palmgren-Miner** damage (`scirust-fatigue`); **inertial tolerancing** (Pillet) — inertia `I=√(δ²+σ²)`, the inertial capability index `Cpi` alongside `Cpm/Cpk/Pp`, 1D tolerance-chain analysis & allocation (worst-case / statistical / weighted / guaranteed-`Cpk` / cost-optimal, cross-checked against arXiv:1002.0270 Table 2), the inertial piloting chart, acceptance sampling via the non-central-χ² law, lot mixing, **surface/modal form tolerancing** (surface inertia as the RMS of point inertias, DCT modal decomposition with the `Σ Iₖ²=m·I_S²` partition identity, arXiv:1002.0251), **3D small-displacement-torsor tolerancing** (normal deviation `e=T·n+R·(OM×n)`, best-fit torsor + form residual, surface inertia `I_S²=θ̄ᵀHθ̄+tr(HΣ)` as the statistical combination of location and orientation, arXiv:1002.0253), **minimum-cost synthesis under several requirements at once** (convex Lagrangian dual, KKT-verified, + cost–quality Pareto frontier), and the measurement-and-analysis layer competitors ship around these methods — **crossed Gage R&R by ANOVA** (AIAG MSA: EV/AV/PV variance components, %study-R&R, ndc, 10 %/30 % verdict), **statistical tolerance intervals** (ISO 16269-6 two-sided Howe and one-sided Natrella factors), **GeoFactor/dual sensitivity** splitting each contributor's pull on the assembly *mean* from its pull on the *variance* (as 3DCS/CETOL do), **ISO 22514-2 distribution fitting** (Normal/Lognormal/Rayleigh/Weibull best-fit + percentile capability), **advanced GD&T** (virtual/resultant condition, datum shift from MMB, two-tier composite position), and **exact Cp / large-sample Cpk confidence intervals**, plus the process-quality reporting layer around them — **variables acceptance sampling** (ISO 3951 / MIL-STD-414 Form-`k`: two-point `(n, k)` design from AQL/RQL and the closed-form OC `Φ(√n(z_p−k))`, known- and unknown-`σ` methods), **Six-Sigma yield accounting** (DPMO/DPU, throughput and rolled-throughput yield, yield↔sigma-level↔DPMO with the 1.5σ shift), and **data-driven root-cause attribution** (a least-squares variance-transmission decomposition of measured assembly variation onto co-measured components, with fitted sensitivities, the exact `Σcⱼ=R²` share identity, and the unexplained remainder that flags an unmodeled cause), plus the go/no-go and reliability primitives that round out a shop-floor quality toolkit — **attributes acceptance sampling** (ISO 2859-1: binomial OC `P(D≤c)` and two-point `(n,c)` design), **stress-strength interference** for assembly-fit reliability (`R=P(strength>stress)=Φ((μ_S−μ_L)/√(σ_S²+σ_L²))`, the clearance-fit probability a random hole/shaft pair assembles — which a worst-case min/max stack cannot give), and a **rational-subgroup capability study** (AIAG/ISO 22514-2: within-subgroup `σ̂=R̄/d₂=s̄/c₄` driving short-term `Cp/Cpk` vs the overall spread driving long-term `Pp/Ppk`, measured from a designed study rather than assumed as a 1.5σ rule); and the drawing-and-economics layer around it — **ISO 286 limits & fits** (standard tolerance grades `ITn` from the factor `i=0.45∛D+0.001D`, shaft fundamental deviations `d–h`, and clearance/transition/interference classification of a hole/shaft pairing), **double and sequential (Wald SPRT) acceptance sampling** (smaller average sample for the same risks, with OC/ASN and the straight accept/reject boundary lines), and the **Taguchi quadratic loss** (the `E[L]=k·I²` identity that makes inertial tolerancing a direct minimiser of quality loss, plus the economic manufacturing tolerance `Δ=Δ₀√(A/A₀)`) (`scirust-tolerance`); and channel-bypass reconfiguration for nuclear reactor-trip **MooN voting** (`scirust-sis::reactor_trip`). Each is wired into `scirust-mcp` as a callable tool.
- **Multi-domain simulation environments** (`scirust-sim`) — the unified "here is a system, step it through time, let an agent interact with it" layer the platform previously lacked: a deterministic time-stepping engine (a `System` trait `y' = f(t, y)` with both fixed-step RK4 **and an error-controlled adaptive Dormand–Prince 5(4)** integrator — the `ode45` scheme, choosing the step automatically so it reproduces `e^{-t}` to 1e-8 in <300 steps where fixed RK4 would need ~1700 — plus a `SecondOrderSystem` trait + **symplectic** semi-implicit Euler, the tests showing the two-body orbit staying closed at a step size where explicit Euler visibly spirals out), a gym-style **`Environment` trait** (`reset` / `step(action) → observation, reward, done`) with the classic **cart-pole** (reference physics constants, seeded bit-replayable episodes) and a deterministic **grid world** — and, behind the optional **`rl` feature**, an `RlEnv` adapter that presents these as a `scirust-learning::rl::Env` so the existing tabular/PPO/deep agents train on them unchanged (a tabular Q-learner provably finds the grid-world shortest path); a seeded **SplitMix64** generator validated against the published reference vectors, and oracle-tested ready-made models in sixteen domains: **mechanics** (spring–mass–damper vs the underdamped closed form, full nonlinear pendulum with energy conservation at large amplitude, projectile with linear drag vs its exact solution, and the **chaotic double pendulum** — energy conserved to 1e-6 along a chaotic orbit, with a demonstrated sensitive dependence on initial conditions where a 1e-8 perturbation grows to O(1)), **orbital** (two-body Kepler: energy and angular momentum conserved to 1e-9, circular orbit closing after exactly one Kepler period), **epidemiology** (SIR/SEIR: population conserved to round-off, epidemic threshold at R₀ = 1, the exact transcendental final-size relation), **ecology** (Lotka–Volterra first integral conserved, logistic closed form), **chemistry** (consecutive reactions vs the Bateman solution, reversible reaction relaxing to K = k_f/k_r, and the canonical **stiff** Robertson benchmark integrated — via the optional `stiff` feature's bridge to `scirust-stiff` — against its reference solution where explicit RK4 blows up), **thermal** (Newton cooling, 1-D heat rod validated on the *discrete* eigenmode decay rate and the maximum principle), **electrical** (RC charging, series RLC vs the damped-oscillator closed form + passivity, and the nonlinear **Van der Pol** oscillator — the library's first *limit cycle*, where trajectories from inside and outside converge onto the same self-sustaining periodic orbit of amplitude ≈ 2), **stochastic/queueing** (GBM and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck sampled by their *exact* transition laws, an M/M/1 discrete-event queue matching L = ρ/(1−ρ), W = 1/(μ−λ) and Little's law), **pharmacokinetics** (oral one-compartment Bateman absorption and IV two-compartment biexponential disposition, the adaptive-integrated AUC recovering the exact `dose/k₁₀`), **rigid-body dynamics** (torque-free Euler equations: kinetic energy and |L|² conserved, symmetric-top precession in closed form, and the intermediate-axis / Dzhanibekov instability), and — turning the industrial verticals' physics into runnable plants — a **Thévenin 1-RC battery** with self-heating (`scirust-bms`: exact coulomb counting, RC/thermal steady states), a **2R2C building-zone** thermal model (`scirust-hvac`: exact linear steady state), and the synchronous-machine **swing equation** (`scirust-grid`: equilibrium `asin(P_m/P_max)`, small-signal frequency, conserved transient energy), plus — the optoelectronics pillar of the radar/optronics track — the single-mode **semiconductor-laser rate equations** (carrier/photon densities: the lasing threshold, the linear light–current law `s = Γ·τ_p·(J − J_th)`, and relaxation-oscillation ringing measured against `f_r = √(g₀·s_ss/τ_p)/2π`) and its detector counterparts, a **photodiode** (optical power → photocurrent → RC-limited voltage: the spectral responsivity `η·q·λ/(h·c)`, the −3 dB bandwidth `1/(2π·R_L·C_j)`, and the exponential step response) and a high-sensitivity **avalanche photodiode** (the McIntyre excess-noise factor `F(M) = k·M + (1−k)(2−1/M)` and the shot-vs-thermal SNR trade-off with its optimal avalanche gain — the lidar/rangefinder receiver). Pure Rust, zero dependencies, `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, `#![deny(missing_docs)]`, explicit seeds everywhere (bit-reproducible runs), Miri-gated in CI — 118 tests + doctests by default, more behind the optional `rl` (RL agents) and `stiff` (stiff plants) features.

`scirust quickstart` prints a decreasing loss and reaches 4/4 on a
non-linearly-separable task — proof the autograd tape, Adam, and the layers
work together. Same seed ⇒ identical numbers, every run.

No `cargo install`? Run any command in place with
`cargo run -p scirust-cli -- <command>`.

## Library API (for embedding)

The CLI is a thin layer over the crates; embed them directly when you need
full control. The 2→8→2 classifier the quickstart trains, in code:

```rust
use scirust_core::autodiff::optim::{Adam, Optimizer};
use scirust_core::autodiff::reverse::{Tape, Tensor};
use scirust_core::nn::{
    CrossEntropyLoss, KaimingNormal, Linear, Loss, Module, PcgEngine, ReLU, Sequential, Zeros,
};

let mut rng = PcgEngine::new(42);
let mut model = Sequential::new()
    .add(Linear::new(2, 8, &KaimingNormal, &Zeros, &mut rng))
    .add(ReLU::new())
    .add(Linear::new(8, 2, &KaimingNormal, &Zeros, &mut rng));
let loss_fn = CrossEntropyLoss::new();
let mut opt = Adam::new(0.05);

let tape = Tape::new();
let x = tape.input(Tensor::from_vec(vec![0.0, 1.0], 1, 2));
let y = tape.input(Tensor::from_vec(vec![0.0, 1.0], 1, 2)); // one-hot
let logits = model.forward(&tape, x);
let loss = loss_fn.forward(&tape, logits, y);
tape.backward(loss.idx());
opt.step(&model.parameter_indices(), &tape);
model.sync(&tape);
```

Add a single crate to your own `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
scirust-core = { path = "path/to/scirust-core" }
```

> GPU note: `scirust-gpu` ships a deterministic CPU reference backend (always
> built; the bit-tolerant oracle) and a real portable **wgpu GEMM** behind the
> optional `wgpu` feature, validated against that oracle on a software Vulkan
> adapter (Mesa lavapipe) in CI. Without the feature/adapter the `wgpu` path
> returns `BackendError::Unavailable` — never fabricated output. It is also
> plumbed into the autograd tape (`WgpuEngine` + `Var::matmul_gpu`) and into
> Conv2d's im2col GEMMs, forward and backward, validated end-to-end on lavapipe.
> `cuda` stays out of scope until a GPU runner exists. Next: keep activations in
> VRAM across layers — see `docs/GPU.md` (P2.2).

## Package layout: framework library vs. bundled agent

The `scirust` package exposes the framework as a **library** (`src/lib.rs`), re-exporting
the member crates under `scirust::{core, simd, symbolic, learning, solvers}`. The
deep-learning and scientific-computing capabilities described here live in those crates.

The repository also bundles a small **experimental autonomous-agent binary**,
`openclaw-u` (`src/main.rs`, run with `cargo run --bin openclaw-u`). It is *not* a
component of the framework, is not required to build or use it, and can be ignored
entirely. Parts of the repository were developed with the assistance of **SoulLink**, a
separate agent system maintained outside this repository; like OpenClaw-U, it is not part
of the framework.








## scirust-sciagent — Deterministic SLM for Rust

The `scirust-sciagent` crate provides a from-scratch transformer trained on Rust source code (672MB from crates.io + The Stack v2).

**Architecture**: GQA + SwiGLU + RoPE + RMSNorm, from 106K to 7B params.

**Configs**:
| Config | Params | Vocab | Layers | Seq Len |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| debug  | 106K   | 256   | 2      | 128     |
| small  | 1.6M   | 8192  | 4      | 256     |
| 350M   | 350M   | 32768 | 24     | 8192    |
| 7B     | 7B     | 32768 | 40     | 8192    |

**Pretrained**: `small` checkpoint (2000 steps, loss 9.01→8.90) at `/tmp/scirust_small_2k/final/`. See `scirust-sciagent/README.md`.

```bash
cargo run --release -p scirust-sciagent --bin sciagent -- --model small \\
  --checkpoint /tmp/scirust_small_2k/final ask "fn main()" --max-tokens 100
```
